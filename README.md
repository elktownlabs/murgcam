# murgcam
Autonomous, time-based, low power still camera.

The first instance of this camera in action:
https://wwv-schwarzwald.de/die-murg/cam

## Project description
This repo documents Hard- and Software for a very low-power, battery/solar powered camera with GSM/LTE connectivity.
It is designed to operate unattended for months in an off-grid environment.
It will upload images to a server on a time-based trigger.

The intended use-case is to monitor river-waterlevels for whitewater paddlers. 
The advantage of a camera over other gauging techniques 
is, only line-of sight is needed, no access to the Water.
Being diectly at the water brings legal and mechanical challenginges that are not at play using a camera.

Full discussion of the original design decisions here:

## Status
The repo just transferred from non-public to public, we try to add more documentation.
Currently, work is going on for a new hardware revision with a few improvements, most notably upgrading to a LTE capable Modem.

## Participation welcome
If you are interested in building / operating such a camera or want to contribute to it's development,
